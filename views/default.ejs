	<p>Traditional Web-serving techniques require each connection (request) to create a new thread, taking up system RAM and eventually maxing-out at the amount of RAM available. Node.js is different. It operates on a single-thread, using non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to support tens of thousands of concurrent connections, without worrying about RAM limitations and the cost of context-switching between threads. The design of sharing a single-thread between all the requests means it can be used to build highly concurrent applications. The design goal of a Node.js application is that any function performing an I/O must use a callback.</p>
